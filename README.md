In this project I wanted make practice with some intermediate css. The design is totally responsive , adaptive to all kind of screen (even the big ones lol), you can find a good (probably abused) use of flexbox and grid, introduced for the first time in my short life 'icons' and playing a video on it (I took it from you tube) .
If you're a programmes get the code and have a look, mi casa es su casa ;) and.. Have fun!
